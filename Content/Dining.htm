                <p>The Grazing Here is a barn-inspired eatery &amp; bar that serves burgers from grass-fed beef. Customers are able to order from a menu or decide to create their own burgerpiece (burger + masterpiece). If that isn’t enough, the Grazing Here regularly features live music regularly. </p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The Georgia Shrimp Company is known for its southern-tinged seafood dishes served in a low-key space. This is the best option when considering diving into the seafood scene in Peachtree City. With live music and a bar with a tapas menu, The Georgia Shrimp Company sure is a catch!</p>
